[h2]Introduction[/h2]
This mod adds a framework to easily add custom victory conditions to the game. Modding victory conditions is notably difficult and time consuming because it requires to create a [i]startpos.esf[/i] file each time. This is a problem for the developer, as it takes more than ten minutes to compile and it leaves no logs, but also for the user, as compatibility with other mods is broken. This framework solves all these problems.

You have to use it together with another mod. The framework will not do anything by itself.
